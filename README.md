# Work in progress

I'll make a proper README later.

Basics to-do:
- Run daily instead of once
- Obtain a longer history window and persist it -> essentially impossible as Kraken limits to 720 points

More interesting to-do:
- How to do backtesting on historic data
- Link this up to Hyperliquid and have it play around
