# Work in progress

I'll make a proper README later.

Basics to-do:
- Run daily instead of once
- Percentage differences in MA's since last run (yesterday)
- Differentiate between differences that are up, down, or flat (what changes are boring)
- Obtain a longer history window and persist it (takes some time to query due to API limits)

More interesting to-do:
- Have the bot "think" about what the differences mean (is this a good/bad development?)
- What would the corresponding trading response be, if anything?
- How to do backtesting on historic data
- Link this up to Hyperliquid and have it play around
