# Work in progress

I'll make a proper README later.

Basics to-do:
- Run daily instead of once
- Obtain a longer history window and persist it (takes some time to query due to API limits)

More interesting to-do:
- How to do backtesting on historic data
- Link this up to Hyperliquid and have it play around
